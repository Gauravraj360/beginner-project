## My process

I have made this project i.e a simple webpage with just 2-3 layout and simply just using with HTML5 and CSS3. I used no framework as I am not familiar with them but I know bootstrap that make this project easy for me but I want to learn and practice my learning in CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned many things while making this project few of them are listed below
1-> Use of position relative & absolute.
2-> to put thing in center alignment even after changing width and that with just adding some margin and padding.
3-> to add a vertical dotted line to customize your webpage with just changing border-width and border-radius.
4-> to narrow down the border radius of any container.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="vl"></div>
```
```css
.vl {
    border-top-width:0px;
    border-bottom-width: 0px;
    border-left: 12px #70bfd6;
    border-right: 12px #70bfd6;
    height: 100px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 0.5%;
    top: 360px;
    border-style: dotted;
    padding:0px 1.5px;
  }
```
```js

```
If you want to see my learnings you can refer to my codes that is simply design and written , I hope this help.


### Continued development

I want to know more about positioning in CSS as I was very confusing while positioning my layout and I want to work on my responsiveness of my web-ppages.

## Acknowledgments

I want to give credit to frontend mentors that give me this challange although it was a beginner's challange but I am beginner and want to learn everything step by steps.
and I also refer to some documentation of mdn docs and w3school and I think documentation is the best help when you don't have any one to help.
